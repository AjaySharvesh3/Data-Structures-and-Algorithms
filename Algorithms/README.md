## **Why Data structure and Algorithms?**

No matter which programming language you program in, if you want to be able to build scalable systems, it is important to learn data structures and algorithms.


## **What is Data structure and Algorithms?**

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.

## **List of algorithms to solve:**

- Array


- Linked List
  Simple linked list with 3 nodes.
  <li>LinkedList.c</li>

  <li>LinkedList.py</li>
  


- Stack
  Simple Stack program using linked list algorithm with 3 push and 1 pop at end.
  <li>Stack.c</li>
  <li>Stack.java</li>
  <li>Stack.py</li>

- Queue
